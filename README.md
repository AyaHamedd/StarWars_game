## 🕹️How to play

Players control their character by using the arrow keys. Use spacebar to shoot a laser beam. The balls split in half when you hit them. To move to the next level, you have to hit all the balls. You have three lives at the beginning of the game. Colliding with a ball will cost you a life. If you lost all three lives then you lose the game and has to start from the beginning.
